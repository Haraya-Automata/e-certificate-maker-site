## **Github Workflow**

***Prerequisite: set pull.rebase to true***

***NOTE! If you already have a copy of our repository, skip this step!***

1. First, have a copy of our program by cloning the github repository.

- Example repository: e-certificate-maker-site

2. Select open repository in visual studio code.

3. Create a branch inside github desktop by clicking the dropdown arrow in current branch and selecting new branch. You can use "feature/yourtaskname" (quotes are not included) for the branch name.

4. You need to do pull (Ctrl+Shift+P) in github desktop in order to get the changes that you or your teammate has made.

5. Start making changes by adding files, creating and implementing the assigned feature/tasks to you. When you think that you've already made significant changes, you must commit your changes by going in github desktop. Then, write your commit message like "add file uploader" (quotes are not included). You can put other information in the description especially if you've made a lot of changes then click commit.

***NOTE! You can break down your task into small chunks of commits, in order for you to preserve your work especially if you think your lines of code will be long.***

6. Publish your branch to origin/remote by clicking push to origin in github.

7. Next, you need to do pull (Ctrl+Shift+P) in github desktop in order to get the changes that you or your teammate has made

8. You can now push your changes to the remote branch by clicking push to origin.

9. Next, you can now preview your pull request and confirm it. Wait for me (**Just**) to review your code and changes. Once approved, you may proceed to the other task if there's one. 

***NOTE! Do not start a new task if your previous task is still pending approval.***

10. Lastly, if you still have a task left you need to repeat this process starting from step 4.
